## QM:GO - An Evolution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of you may know, I started developing Quality Muncher's Go version a while ago. When I started that, I already felt like Quality Muncher Batch was completed. There was little more I could add, especially considering the limitations of the language, such as a lack of support for floats (decimals). Go was a good choice, and I managed to do a lot of what I felt like I couldn't with Batch. I finally added progress bars for all types of rendering, and greatly improved the general use of a lot of features. But, like in Batch, I found myself wading through thicker and thicker waters. It was more and more difficult to add things, because new features required much more advanced techniques and would soon require switching from FFmpeg.
 ## So What Comes Next?
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked myself that, I hadn't even thought of an answer. But the answer found me. I began to work less frequently on Quality Muncher. Ideas became more and more sparse, and my motivation dwindled. Eventually I realized that I had done it - I'd completed Quality Muncher. Although I always thought there would be more to add, more to create, more to expand upon, there was not. That's why I haven't posted or sent any updates regarding QM in these last few months. There are no updates to post, no news to send. As far as my contributions go, Quality Muncher has been completed. Aside from occassional bug fixes when I notice issues, there will likely not be any more updates. I've learned a great deal from this project and met many fantastic people, who I would not be here without. Perhaps, in time, I may return to QM, but I know not what the future may hold.
 ## Conclusion
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QM:GO was released a few months ago. The GitHub page can be found at [](https://go.qualitymuncher.lgbt). If any of you would like to use my work in other projects, feel free to, but remember to abide by the license (GPL v3.0) and credit me appropriately if you feel generous. For now, I'll still be working on some [side projects](https://github.com/Thqrn/ffmpeg-scripts) and I'm fairly active in [Couleur's server.](https://discord.gg/ctt). If you'd like, you can message me on Discord at @froest. Thank you for your time and your support.
