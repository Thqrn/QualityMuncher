# Quality Muncher

This is the unstable branch of Quality Muncher. Everything you see here will most likely have a lot of bugs, but new features.

# Current New Features

none since i justed updated the main branch with this

# Planned

 - a backup update option using the powershell script in case i am a dumbass again
 - information/credits/disclaimers etc page in the menu or maybe extras
 - more comments on code (maybe needed? idk how complex this seems to someone who didn't write it)
 - sort the functions better (very disorganized)
 - ???

# Bugs

Feel free to make a report on any bugs you find, just make sure to specify that it is on the unstable branch.
