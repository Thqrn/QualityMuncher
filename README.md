# Quality Muncher

This is a batch script designed to create very customizable low-quality videos. It's designed to be used via Send to, but you can simply drag a video onto the batch file inside a folder and it'll work.\
Please note that it's still in development, so please message me (Frost#5872) if you have any bugs, issues, questions, or suggestions, or join my discord server: https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# Features
 - adding an audio file to the video

# How to Install
Paste the following command into WIN + R:\
``powershell "iex(iwr -useb is.gd/qlmunch)"``

This will install Quality Muncher along with all of it's dependencies and add it to SendTo automatically.

# Usage
Right click on your video, hover over "Send to" and select QualityMuncher.bat 

After that, follow the prompts it gives you. Please try not to use any "poison" characters (spaces, slashes, commas, some symbols) as it will cause the file to malfunction. If you have any issues or questions, dm me on discord.

Please answer the prompts correctly and read carefully, as answering incorrectly may cause errors or crashes.

# Multiqueue
The normal Quality Muncher batch file does not support multiqueue. However, with the "!!qualitymuncher multiqueue.bat" file, it does. To use this, select as many videos as you'd like, then send them to the multiqueue file. Then enter in the preset and watch as your videos are processed. For this to work, your both the multiqueue file and quality muncher MUST be in the same directory.
