# Quality Muncher

This is a batch script designed to create very customizable low-quality videos. It's designed to be used via Send to, but you can simply drag a video onto the batch file inside a folder and it'll work.\
Please note that it's still in development, so please message me (Frost#5872) if you have any bugs, issues, questions, or suggestions, or join my discord server: https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# Features
 - adding an audio file to the video
 - ability to chose playback speed
 - embeds nicely in discord
 - low file size
 - adding text to video
 - custom start and duration times
 - consistent updates and new features
 - 4 presets and custom options
 - setting custom output fps, audio bitrate, video bitrate, and scale
 - very few bugs or issues, program tells you if you might've entered something wrong (work in progress)
 - bass boosting audio
 - stretched resolution output
 - custom saturation, contrast, and brightness values
 - and more!

# How to Install
Paste the following command into WIN + R:\
``powershell irm is.gd/qlmunch|iex``

^ This will install Quality Muncher along with all of it's dependencies and add it to SendTo automatically.

# Usage
Right click on your video, hover over "Send to" and select QualityMuncher.bat 

After that, follow the prompts it gives you. Please try not to use any "poison" characters (spaces, slashes, commas, some symbols) as it will cause the file to malfunction. If you have any issues or questions, dm me on discord.

Please answer the prompts correctly and read carefully.

*note: videos with a lot of movement will look significantly worse than more stationary videos due to how bitrate works*
