# Frost#5872's Quality Muncher
*I'm Frost#5872 if you couldn't tell.*

This is a batch file designed to create very customizable low-quality videos. It's designed to be used as a "send to" file, or you can simply drag a video onto the batch file and it'll work. Please note that it's still in development, so please message me if you have any bugs, issues, questions, or suggestions, or join my discord server: https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# Features
 - changing scale
 - changing audio and videobitrate seperately
 - adding an mp3 file to the video in low quality
 - custom start and duration times
 - 4 presets
 - very few bugs or issues, program tells you if you might've entered something wrong (work in progress)
# How to Install
First you need ffmpeg (tutorial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwWITnuWQW4).

Second, download the .bat file in this repository.

Third, put the .bat file in C:\Users\ *YOUR USERNAME HERE*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo

After that, drag it to C:\Users\ YOUR USERNAME HERE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo
# How to Use
To use, simply right click a video and hover over "send to" and click "Frost's Quality Muncher" (there might be 1.x.x or some numbers in front of Frost)

After that, follow the prompts it gives you. If you have any issues or questions, dm me on discord.

Please answer the prompts correctly and read carefully.

*note: videos with a lot of movement will look significantly worse than more stationary videos due to bitrate*
