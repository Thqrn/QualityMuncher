# Frost#5872's Quality Muncher
*I'm Frost#5872 if you couldn't tell.*

This is a batch file designed to create very customizable low-quality videos. It's designed to be used as a "send to" file, or you can simply drag a video onto the batch file and it'll work. Please note that it's still in development, so please message me if you have any bugs, issues, questions, or suggestions, or join my discord server: https://discord.gg/9tRZ6C7tYz

# How to Use
Guide to the simple drag and drop method: https://youtu.be/yXTWX_JEQs4

To use, simply right click a video and hover over "send to" and click "Frost's Quality Muncher" (there might be 1.x.x or some numbers in front of Frost)

After that, follow the prompts it gives you. If you have any issues or questions, dm me on discord.

Please answer the prompts correctly and read carefully.

*note: videos with a lot of movement will look significantly worse than more stationary videos due to bitrate*
